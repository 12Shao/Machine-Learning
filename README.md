Various machine learning scripts and projects that I've done

popcorn.sentiment.sklearn.py - basic sentiment analysis script that converts list of phrases into bag of words features and does logistic regression. Achieved kaggle score of .962 and 8th place at the time of writing. https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/leaderboard

LinearRegression.py - python version of simple linear regression from scratch!

LogisticRegression.py - gradient descent logistic regression. Currently gets 60% on admission dataset whereas R's default logistic regression gets 70%.j

BackPropagationNN.py - Basic MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) network, adapted and from the book 'Programming Collective Intelligence' (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do) Consists of three layers: input, hidden and output. The sizes of input and output must match data the size of hidden is user defined when initializing the network. The algorithm has been generalized to be used on any dataset.
